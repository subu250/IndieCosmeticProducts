                href="https://makingskincare.com/">Elegant.com</a>, A common complaint of non-water
            containing products, such as body butters and balms are they are greasy, heavy and can be grainy.
            These complaints can be solved by creating an emulsion.  Emulsions allow oils and butters to be applied to the skin in an aesthetically pleasing fashion and offers the formulator a great degree of formulation flexibility and easy modification of characteristics such as viscosity, feel and appearance.
            Emulsions allow otherwise incompatible ingredients, such as oils,
            glycerine and actives to be brought together in the same product.
